First, you must put a Pok√©mon Emerald (US) ROM in the root directory of the repository and name it `baserom.gba`. It should have a SHA1 checksum of `f3ae088181bf583e55daf962a92bb46f4f1d07b7`. Then, follow the OS-specific instructions below.

# Linux

TBD

# Windows

Install [**devkitARM**](http://devkitpro.org/wiki/Getting_Started/devkitARM).

Then get the compiled tools from https://github.com/YamaArashi/pokeruby-tools. Copy the "tools" folder over the "tools" folder in your pokeemerald directory.

You can then build pokeemerald using "make" in the MSYS environment provided with devkitARM.
